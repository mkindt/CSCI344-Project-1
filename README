In designing my layout I looked at several sites linked to from Foundation.
First is Reel.  I was interested in the way this site used an image to pull one
into a straightforward splash for a search.

I was also interested in the column and section arrangement of another of Reel's pages.

This arrangement is done well at Designosource. Here I also liked their use of textures
and compelling images and theme.  This site also had three columns that worked nicely.
I also thought the menu that moves with you is a useful addition.

Plunk also enforced the notion of three columns, textures and a simpler search screen.
It also had some playful elements like Designosource did.
